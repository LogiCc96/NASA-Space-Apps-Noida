    <p>
      Carbon dioxide and methane are the two dominant gasses that contribute to
      climate change. Methane traps more heat in the atmosphere per molecule
      than carbon dioxide, therefore targeting reductions in anthropogenic
      methane emissions offers an effective approach to decrease overall
      atmospheric warming. Methane and carbon dioxide have distinct absorption
      features in the shortwave infrared (1800-2500nm) that permit the detection
      and mapping of point source greenhouse gas emissions with EMIT data.
      Identifying strong emission sources offers the potential to improve our
      understanding of anthropogenic emissions and to mitigate those emissions.
      For example, oil & gas operators can locate and fix leaks that are both
      expensive and environmentally damaging, providing a win-win opportunity.
      Other sectors could use this information to identify opportunities for
      methane capture for either flaring or conversion to fuel resources

    <h1>Potential Application Areas</h1>

    <p>
      Assessing the risk of hazards, both before they occur and in response to
      events, allows for more effective planning and implementation of disaster
      response efforts. EMIT data could enable detection of a variety of natural
      hazards and could be used to guide disaster management strategies. For
      example, it is possible to use reflectance data like those from EMIT to
      locate the distribution of particular minerals on the slopes of volcanoes
      which can indicate increased likelihood of debris flows, allowing
      communities to plan around these high risk areas. Another example is flood
      response, where EMIT data could provide information on flood extent,
      ecosystem impacts, and surface water sediment load
